"""
Ghost Racer — Lap Time Prediction Model (relative pace)

Predicts how fast a lap SHOULD be given tyre compound, tyre age and fuel
load, and flags laps that are faster/slower than expected.

HOW IT WORKS (v2):
The model does not predict raw lap time. Raw lap time is mostly "which
track is this" (Monaco ~75 s, Spa ~110 s), and the first version learned
exactly that: it looked accurate (0.61 s) on random laps from races it had
already seen, but on races it had NEVER seen its error was ~8.6 s per lap,
and it predicted the same pace for SOFT, MEDIUM and HARD.

Instead, every lap is compared with that driver's typical (median) lap in
the same race:

    expected lap = driver's typical lap this race + predicted delta
    predicted delta = f(compound, tyre age, fuel load, track temperature)

so the model only has to learn the physics (tyres wear, fuel burns off).
A linear regression does this best: on 5 different sets of held-out races
it averaged 0.540 s error vs 0.792 s for the baseline (and 0.615 s for a
gradient-boosting version).

HONEST TESTING: whole races are held out -- the model is tested on races it
never trained on, and compared with the simple guess "the driver's typical
lap this race".

Only dry, green-flag laps on SOFT/MEDIUM/HARD are used (no pit laps, no lap 1,
no wet races, no laps 3+ s off the driver's typical pace = traffic/mistakes).

ASSUMPTION: each lap uses its race's AVERAGE weather (the laps table has no
timestamp to match exact weather samples).
